Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah) explained why she believes minority voters often gravitate toward Democratic candidates, sometimes against their own self-interest, during her concession speech Monday,\'a0CNN\'a0reported.\
Love recently lost her House seat to Democratic challenger Ben McAdams after representing Utah\'92s 4th District since 2015. In her concession speech after losing a drawn out race, Love criticized the president and offered some perspective on how the GOP can make inroads with minority voters.\
What did Trump have to gain?\'a0President Donald Trump brought national attention to the race between Love and McAdams by\'a0mocking the congresswoman\'a0after the election was prematurely called in favor of McAdams.\
Love\'a0worked closely with Trump\'a0to secure the freedom of Utah resident Josh Holt from his Venezuelan imprisonment, but her campaign still kept its distance from the president, which Trump pointed out.\cb1 \
\cb3 \'93Mia Love gave me no love and she lost,\'94 Trump said. \'93Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\'94\
Monday, Love questioned why a Republican president would take a shot like that at a member of his own party.\
\'93The president\'92s behavior towards me made me wonder: What did he have to gain by saying such a thing about a fellow Republican?\'94 Love said. \'93It was not really about asking him to do more, was it? Or was it something else? Well Mr. President, we\'92ll have to chat about that.\
\'93However, this gave me a clear vision of his world as it is. No real relationships, just convenient transactions. That is an insufficient way to implement sincere service and policy.\'94\
Why minorities shun Republicans:\'a0Building on her point about the transactional nature of Trump\'92s politics, Love said that type of interaction alienates minorities.\
\'93This election experience and these comments shines a spotlight on the problems Washington politicians have with minorities and black Americans \'97 it\'92s transactional, it\'92s not personal.\
\'93You see, we feel like politicians claim they know what\'92s best for us from a safe distance, yet they\'92re never willing to take us home,\'94 she continued. \'93Because Republicans never take minority communities into their home and citizens into their homes and into their hearts, they stay with Democrats and bureaucrats in Washington because they do take them home \'97 or at least make them feel like they have a home.\'94\
