One hundred and fifty-five years ago this week, Abraham Lincoln traveled to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to give a two-minute speech. He and other dignitaries gathered to honor at least 23,000 Union soldiers who gave their lives on the field of battle that summer. Those young men fought, Lincoln said, so that \'93this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom\'97and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\'94 They died so that the Union and American democracy itself could live.\cb1 \
\cb3 This week\'92s New York magazine offers a rebuttal of sorts. Journalist Sasha Issenberg {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/maybe-its-time-for-america-to-split-up.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 published a lengthy meditation}} that asks whether the United States should be broken up. He readily admits that this is not a new idea. Contrarian writers revisit the idea every few years as they fret about the nation\'92s political divisions. Fringe secessionist movements in Alaska, California, and Vermont wield virtually no political influence. Presidential elections, where the nation\'92s red/blue divide is laid bare, often lead to an uptick in chatter on whether our politics can long endure.\cb1 \
\cb3 Issenberg, to his credit, adds a new twist on the concept. Most of the article is framed around interstate compacts, a constitutional mechanism that allows the states to create binding legal agreements amongst themselves. Issenberg fleshes out the idea that Congress could effectively transfer its interstate policy-making powers to the states by giving them a blank check to write these compacts. (Currently, Congress has to sign off on any substantive agreement between the states.) Red states and blue states could then band together with like-minded neighbors to pass their own common laws on healthcare, organized labor, housing, the environment, and more.\cb1 \
\cb3 This doesn\'92t sound like secessionism, of course. But Issenberg acknowledges that it may lead there. \'93It may be time to take the country apart and put it back together, into a shape that better aligns with the divergent, and increasingly irreconcilable, political preferences of its people\'97or at least to consider what such a future might look like, if for no other reason than to test our own resolve,\'94 he wrote. \'93An imagined trial separation, if you will.\'94\cb1 \
\cb3 Yet it\'92s hard to look at this hypothetical and not come away convinced that a truly united United States is vastly better than the alternative: Many of the problems Issenberg identifies can be tackled through existing mechanisms, albeit with some effort and organizing. Separating the states would instead entrench partisan divides into American political structures, giving permanence to what may be fleeting political moods. It would diminish the social and cultural influence of millions of Americans, particularly communities of color in the red states. And it would raise the specter of armed conflict on North American soil for the first time in a century.\cb1 \
\cb3 In fact, individual states already have ample tools to act beyond the federal government if they wish it. In the last two years, for example, California {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.npr.org/2018/09/01/643909884/california-lawmakers-pass-net-neutrality-bill"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 passed}} a net-neutrality bill, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/business/energy-environment/california-upholds-emissions-standards-setting-up-face-off-with-trump.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 raised}} emissions standards for cars, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://time.com/4960233/california-sanctuary-state-donald-trump/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 declared itself}} a sanctuary state to resist federal immigration policies. (The Trump administration is waging a legal battle against all three measures.) I\'92ve written about how liberals can {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://newrepublic.com/article/151640/can-state-courts-save-liberal-agenda"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 still use state courts and state constitutions}} to pursue their legal agenda even as the federal judiciary drifts further to the right.\cb1 \

\cf2 \cb3 Attempting to unravel the Union, on the other hand, would mark the beginning of the end for America\'92s experiment in self-government. It isn\'92t anti-democratic in the sense that it favors authoritarianism; what it rejects is the idea that American democracy can still work at all\'97that a vast, multicultural nation can resolve differences and tackle problems through compromise and consensus. The rough-and-tumble politics that characterize a democratic society under the dissolutionist view are seen not as a process to engage with, but a flaw to be corrected. The active goal of such a plan would be a patchwork system of stagnant, ultra-majoritarian governments where power could not be persuaded.\cb1 \
\cb3 Americans have the right to alter their political structures as they see fit, of course. Dismantling the Union, however, would be a permanent solution to what is essentially a transitory political problem. Consider the \'93Jesusland\'94 map. The 2004 viral illustration {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/magazine/19wwln_lede.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 depicted}} a \'93United States of Canada\'94 formed by the states that voted for John Kerry in that year\'92s election and their northern neighbor, while the states won by George W. Bush devoted themselves to cultural conservatism. The map seems almost quaint today. Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Virginia\'97all Jesusland states a decade and a half ago\'97are now solidly blue. Democrats even made strong showings in Georgia and Texas during this year\'92s midterms, while Florida remains as narrowly divided as elsewhere. Had Issenberg published his article after the 2004 election, his system would have sorted millions of Americans into an ideological group that they would soon abandon.\cb1 \
\cb3 What\'92s more, many states\'92 politics can\'92t be easily reduced to their color on a map. New England will send a virtually all-Democratic delegation to Congress after this year\'92s midterms, leaving Maine Senator Susan Collins as the region\'92s last GOP lawmaker. At the same time, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont are all currently led by popular Republican governors. Voters in Idaho, Nebraska, and Utah {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/07/utah-idaho-and-nebraska-approve-medicaid-expansion-ballot-measures.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 simultaneously chose}} to expand their states\'92 Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, while also sending a slate of Republican lawmakers back to Congress who largely support repealing the landmark healthcare law.\cb1 \
\cb3 On many issues, Americans aren\'92t as sharply divided as the political rhetoric suggests. Polls {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-83-percent-support-pathway-to-citizenship-for-illegal-immigrants"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 often}} {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/poll-illegal-immigration-trump-236162"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 show}} {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/17/politics/poll-oppose-trump-deportation-immigration-policy/index.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 widespread support}} for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in some form. Almost two-thirds of Americans {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/08/americans-support-marijuana-legalization/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 think marijuana should be legalized}}. Few issues are as divisive as abortion rights, but a July poll found that 71 percent {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/nbc-wsj-poll-support-roe-v-wade-hits-new-high-n893806"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 oppose overturning Roe v. Wade}}. A whopping 90 percent {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/03/chris-abele/do-90-americans-support-background-checks-all-gun-/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 support universal background checks}} for gun ownership. There\'92s even a strong consensus in liberal and conservative policy circles that mass incarceration should be rolled back, though the two sides often disagree about the solutions.\cb1 \
\cb3 So why doesn\'92t national policy reflect these views? Congress, for one, is a politically impotent institution. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome/570832/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 helped transform}} the House of Representatives into a hollow theater for partisan spectacle by waging permanent political campaigns and shredding bipartisan legislative norms. He also {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/gingrich-and-the-destruction-of-congressional-expertise/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 shut down}} nonpartisan sources of expertise like the Office of Technology Assessment, Congress\'92s in-house advisory body on tech issues. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/10/25/suffocation-of-democracy/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 similar}} {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/gop-decay-of-political-norms/540165/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 impact}} in the upper chamber, where he nudged the once-collegial body into maximalist partisanship and constitutional hardball. Republicans shoulder most of the blame for Congress\'92s decline, but leaders from both parties have contributed by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/gallagher-congress/575689/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 centralizing their power}} at the cost of traditional avenues for legislative work.\cb1 \
\cb3 The average American also exercises less influence over their elected representatives than in years past. Republicans today enjoy a cascade of structural advantages that insulate them from the popular will. President Donald Trump captured the presidency despite losing the popular vote by almost three million ballots, then appointed two Supreme Court justices who will secure a conservative majority for at least a generation. A decade of partisan gerrymandering by the GOP forced Democratic candidates to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-11-17/midterm-elections-reveal-effects-of-gerrymandered-districts"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 win by overwhelming margins}} just to secure a majority in the House. The red states fare little better: Voter suppression in Georgia {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/7/18071438/midterm-election-results-voting-rights-georgia-florida"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 appears to have secured}} Governor-elect Brian Kemp\'92s razor-thin victory, while warped legislative maps in Wisconsin {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/courts/election-results-strengthen-partisan-gerrymandering-case-says-group-that-sued/article_90ce0609-91a7-557b-85c2-e5831f84e5a3.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 allowed}} Republicans to keep control of both houses while Democrats got more statewide vote.\cb1 \
\cb3 Many of these problems are ultimately fixable. Redistricting reform at the state level, a new Voting Rights Act at the federal level, statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and decentralizing power in Congress are all practical options in the near-to-medium future. Maine\'92s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bangordailynews.com/2018/11/19/politics/maine-led-the-nation-with-ranked-choice-voting-will-others-follow/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 experiment in ranked-choice voting}}, if adopted more widely, could give voters more options beyond the two-party system. Abolishing the Electoral College would also be a worthy long-term fight. If nothing else, these solutions are at least less extreme than dissolving the Union.\cb1 \
\cb3 In the end, any dissolution would still raise the question of how states would resolve conflict. Issenberg proposes a system based on an unwritten truce. \'93To kick off the Federation Era, the [governors of California and Texas] meet on the steps of the United States Supreme Court for a photo op,\'94 he wrote. \'93Shaking hands, the men and their attorneys general pledge not to support any legal challenge to the other\'92s authority for two decades.\'94\cb1 \
\cb3 Like any norm, this legal ceasefire would work until it doesn\'92t. Say, for example, that Nevada\'92s water problems get even worse over the next few decades. The state is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/the-disappearing-river"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 already under siege}} by a steady influx of new residents that increases demand, and a persistent drought that\'92s reducing supply. Climate change will only make things even worse. Suppose that, ten years into this brave new world, the state were to pull out of the Colorado River Compact and start diverting even more water to keep Las Vegas afloat. What recourse would California and the blue states have to remedy the situation outside of the courts?\cb1 \
\cb3 In the 1930s, Arizona and California {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-parker-dam-20150831-story.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 waged a cold war}} for control of the Colorado River and a proposed dam that would divert more water to the Los Angeles area. The standoff peaked in 1934 when Arizona Governor Benjamin Moeur called up the state\'92s National Guard and deployed it to halt construction of the Parker Dam, defying the six states then belonging to the interstate compact and the federal government that was overseeing the project. The Roosevelt administration appealed to the courts to block Moeur from obstructing the work. The Supreme Court, however, ultimately {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/295/174/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 sided with Arizona}} and vindicated the state\'92s use of military force.\cb1 \
\cb3 Cooler heads ultimately prevailed, Arizona soon joined the compact, and the Parker Dam stands today. In a weaker system, however, it would be easy to imagine that conflict having gone further than it did, even without today\'92s hyper-partisan atmosphere. Testing that hypothesis hardly seems worth the risk. To borrow {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://ask.un.org/faq/14623"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 a line from former UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\'f6ld}}, the Union exists not to bring Americans from heaven but to save us from hell. It also gives form to an immutable truth about human politics: We are all, for better or worse, in this together.}
